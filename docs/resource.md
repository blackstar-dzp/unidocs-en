#### 关于各端的管理规则需要耐心学习
#### The management rules on each side need to be patiently studied

uni-app并不难学，但我们注意到很多新人在适应各个平台的规则限制时比较急躁。
Uni-app is not difficult to learn, but we have noticed that many newcomers are impatient when adapting to the rules and restrictions of each platform.

每个端，有每个端的管理规则，这不是uni-app在技术层面上可以抹平的：
On each end, there are management rules for each end, which cannot be smoothed out by uni-app at the technical level:

- 比如H5端的浏览器有跨域限制；
- For example, the browser on the H5 side has cross-domain restrictions;
- 比如App端，iOS对隐私控制和虚拟支付控制非常严格；
- For example, on the App side, iOS is very strict on privacy control and virtual payment control;
- 如果你的App要使用三方sdk，比如定位、地图、支付、推送...还要遵循他们的规则和限制；
- If your App needs to use three-party SDKs, such as location, map, payment, push... also follow their rules and restrictions;
遇事耐心，不急不躁，虽然这不是成功的唯一要素，但它是你技术路上长远走下去的基础。
Be patient and not rushed. Although this is not the only element of success, it is the foundation for your long-term technical journey.
